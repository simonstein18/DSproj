<h1 style="text-align:center">Data Structures for Data Analysis for Data Visualization</h1>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Simon Stein</h3>

<p style="text-align:center">I wanted to analyze data on one of the greatest sports season of all time, the Premier League 15/16 season. Leicester City, in their 
second season back in the league, won the title for the club's first time. The path towards the title was not easy, top teams fought every matchday 
for first place. To analyze this battle, I looked through every matchday, calculated the top five team's total points after each matchday, and combined them into a scatterplot.</p>

<img src="Figure_1.png" style="width:600px;height:500px" class="center">

<h1 style="text-align:center">1. The Data</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"> I drew from <a href="https://datahub.io/sports-data/english-premier-league#resource-season-1516">datahub.io</a></p>

<h1 style="text-align:center">2. The Structure</h1>
<p style="text-align:center"> The data set was approximately 102kb in size encoded as a .csv files. I read the files line by line and stored the Home Team's name, Away Team's name, and the Winner or each game in a list.
I then stored the team's name as the first element of each row in a two-dimmensional</p>

    <pre><code style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
with open('/Users/simonneuwirth-stein/Desktop/season-1516.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
# creating a csv reader object
csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)

for row in csvreader:
    keys.append([row[2], row[3], row[6]]) #(Home Team, Away Team, Winner)

    #list of clubs
    if row[2] not in clubs:
        clubs.append(row[2])
#taking out header
clubs.pop(0)

ary = []
#inserting the club name as the first element in each row of the array
for i in range(len(clubs)):
ary.insert(i, [clubs[i]])
ary[i].append(0)
    </pre></code>

<p style="text-align:center">
I then looped through each game played throughout the season, aka list "keys".
I added 3 to the Home Team's previous points in the row into the two-dimmensional array if they won,
0 if they lost, and 1 if they tied. And vice versa for the Away Team.
</p>
<pre><code style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">
for match in keys: #[Home Team, Away Team, Winner]
    for i in range(len(ary)): #running through all of the 2d-array of team

        #Home team
        if ary[i][0] == match[0]: # if selected team is Home Team in match
            if match[2] == "H":
                ary[i].append(3 + ary[i][-1])
            elif match[2] == "A":
                ary[i].append(0 + ary[i][-1])
            else:
                ary[i].append(1 + ary[i][-1])
        
        #Away team
        if ary[i][0] == match[1]: # if selected team is Away Team in match
            if match[2] == "A":
                ary[i].append(3 + ary[i][-1])
            elif match[2] == "H":
                ary[i].append(0 + ary[i][-1])
            else:
                ary[i].append(1 + ary[i][-1])

<p style="text-align:left">
I'm pleased with how it turned out, and offer a few thoughts.
<ul style="text-align:left">
    <li>Could Spurs or Arsenal have won the title?</li>
    <li>Could a different team like Leicester City ever pull off a season like this?</li>
    <li>What other data structures could I have used?</li>
